Preface 
 
 The writer of these verses was born in the Clarendon 
 Hills of Jamaica in 1889. In 1911 he published a small 
 volume in the Negro dialect, and later left for the United 
 States where he worked in various occupations and took 
 courses in Agriculture and English at the Kansas State 
 College. In the spring of this year he visited England to 
 arrange for the publication of his poems. 
 
 Claude McKay is a pure blooded Negro, and though 
 we have recently been made aware of some of the more 
 remarkable achievements of African Art typified by the 
 sculpture from Benin, and in music by the Spirituals, 
 this is the first instance of success in poetry with which 
 we in Europe at any rate have been brought into contact. 
 The reasons for this late development are not far to seek, 
 and the difficulties presented by modern literary English 
 as an acquired medium would be sufficient to account for 
 the lacuna ; but the poems here selected may, in the 
 opinion of not a few who have seen them in periodical 
 form, claim a place beside the best work that the present 
 generation is producing in this country.
