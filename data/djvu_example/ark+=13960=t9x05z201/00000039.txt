The Harlem Dancer V 
 
 Applauding youths laughed with young prostitutes 
 
 And watched her perfect, half-clothed body sway ; 
 
 Her voice was like the sound of blended flutes 
 
 Blown by black players upon a picnic day. 
 
 She sang and danced on gracefully and calm, 
 
 The light gauze hanging loose about her form ; 
 
 To me she seemed a proudly-swaying palm 
 
 Grown lovelier for passing through a storm. 
 
 Upon her swarthy neck black, shiny curls 
 
 Profusely fell ; and, tossing coins in praise, 
 
 The wine-flushed, bold-eyed boys, and even the girls, 
 
 Devoured her with eager, passionate gaze : 
 
 But, looking at her falsely-smiling face, 
 
 I knew her self was not in that strange place.
