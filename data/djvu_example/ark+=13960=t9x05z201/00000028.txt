A Memory of June 
 
 When June comes dancing o er the death of May, 
 With scarlet roses tinting- her green breast, 
 
 And mating thrushes ushering in her day, 
 And Earth on tiptoe for her golden guest, 
 
 I always see the evening when we met 
 The first of June baptised in tender rain 
 
 And walked home through the wide streets, gleaming 
 
 wet, 
 Arms locked, our warm flesh pulsing with love s pain. 
 
 I always see the cheerful little room, 
 
 And in the corner, fresh and white, the bed 
 
 Sweet scented with a delicate perfume, 
 
 Wherein for one night only we were wed : 
 
 Where in the starlit stillness we lay mute 
 
 And heard the whispering showers all night long, 
 
 And your brown burning body was a lute 
 
 Whereon wild passion played his fevered song. 
 
 When June comes dancing o er the death of May, 
 With scarlet roses staining her fair feet, 
 
 My soul takes leave of me to sing all day 
 A night of rare love, perfect and complete.
