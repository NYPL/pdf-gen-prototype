In the East the clouds glow crimson with the new dawn 
 
 that is breaking, 
 
 And its golden glory fills the western skies: 
 Oh my brothers and my sisters, wake ! arise! 
 For the new birth rends the old earth and the very dead 
 
 are waking, 
 
 Ghosts are turned flesh, throwing off the grave s dis 
 guise, 
 
 And the foolish, even children, are made wise; 
 For the big earth groans in travail for the strong, new 
 
 world in making 
 
 Oh my brothers, dreaming for long centuries, 
 Wake from sleeping; to the East turn, turn your eyes!
