Flame-Heart 
 
 So much have I forgotten in ten years, 
 
 So much in ten brief years ; I have forgot 
 What time the purple apples come to juice 
 
 And what month brings the shy forget-me-not; 
 Forgotten is the special, startling season 
 
 Of some beloved tree s flowering and fruiting, 
 What time of year the ground doves brown the fields- 
 
 And fill the noonday with their curious fluting: 
 I have forgotten much, but still remember 
 The poinsettia s red, blood-red in warm December. 
 
 I still recall the honey- fever grass, 
 
 But I cannot bring back to mind just when 
 We rooted them out of the ping- wing path 
 
 To stop the mad bees in the rabbit pen. 
 I often try to think in what sweet month 
 
 The languid painted ladies used to dapple 
 The yellow bye road mazing from the main, 
 
 Sweet with the golden threads of the rose-apple: 
 I have forgotten, strange, but quite remember 
 The poinsettia s red, blood-red in warm December. 
 
 What weeks, what months, what time o the mild year 
 
 We cheated school to have our fling at tops ? 
 What days our wine-thrilled bodies pulsed with joy 
 
 Feasting upon blackberries in the copse ? 
 Oh some I know! I have embalmed the days, 
 
 Even the sacred moments, when we played, 
 All innocent of passion uncorrupt, 
 
 At noon and evening in the flame-heart s shade: 
 We were so happy, happy, I remember 
 Beneath the poinsettia s red in warm December.
