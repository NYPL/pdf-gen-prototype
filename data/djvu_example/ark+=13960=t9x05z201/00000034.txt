The Castaways 
 
 The vivid grass with visible delight 
 
 Spring-ing- triumphant from the pregnant earth ; 
 
 And butterflies, and sparrows in brief flight 
 
 Chirping and dancing for the season s birth, 
 
 And dandelions and rare daffodils 
 
 That hold the deep-stirred heart with hands of gold 
 
 And thrushes sending forth their joyous trills ; 
 
 Not these, not these did I at first behold : 
 
 But seated on the benches daubed with green, 
 
 The castaways of earth, some fast asleep, 
 
 With many a withered woman wedged between, 
 
 And over all life s shadows dark and deep : 
 
 Moaning I turned away, for misery 
 
 I have the strength to bear but not to see.
