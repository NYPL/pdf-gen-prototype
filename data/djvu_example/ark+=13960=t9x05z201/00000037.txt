In Bondage 
 
 I would be wandering in distant fields 
 
 Where man, and bird, and beast, lives leisurely,. 
 
 And the old earth is kind and ever yields 
 
 Her goodly gifts to all her children free; 
 
 Where life is fairer, lighter, less demanding, 
 
 And boys and girls have time and space for play 
 
 Before they come to years of understanding, 
 
 Somewhere I would be singing, far away ; 
 
 For life is greater than the thousand wars 
 
 Men wage for it in their insatiate lust, 
 
 And will remain like the eternal stars 
 
 When all that is to-day is ashes and dust: 
 
 But I am bound with you in your mean graves, 
 
 Oh black men, simple slaves of ruthless slaves.^
