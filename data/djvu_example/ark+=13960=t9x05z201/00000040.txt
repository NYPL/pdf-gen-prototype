A Prayer 
 
 (For Max Eastman) 
 
 *Mid the discordant noises of the day I hear thee calling, 
 I stumble as I fare along Earth s way; keep me from 
 falling. 
 
 Mine eyes are open but they cannot see for gloom of night ; 
 I can no more than lift my heart to thee for inward light. 
 
 The wild and fiery passion of my youth consumes my soul; 
 In agony I turn to thee for truth and self-control. 
 
 For Passion and all the pleasures it can give will die the 
 
 death ; 
 But this of me eternally must live, thy borrowed breath. 
 
 Mid the discordant noises of the day I hear thee calling, 
 I stumble as I fare along Earth s way; keep me from 
 falling.
