On Broadway 
 
 About me young and careless feet 
 Linger along- the garish street ; 
 
 Above, a hundred shouting signs 
 Shed down their bright fantastic glow 
 
 Upon the merry crowd and lines 
 Of moving carriages below : 
 O wonderful is Broadway only 
 My heart, my heart is lonely. 
 
 Desire naked, linked with Passion, 
 Goes strutting by in brazen fashion ; 
 
 From playhouse, cabaret and inn 
 The rainbow lights of Broadway blaze 
 All gay without, all glad within ; 
 
 in a dream I stand and gaze 
 At Broadway, shining Broadway only 
 V.._.My heart, my heart is lonely.
