To O.E.A. 
 
 Your voice is the colour of a robin s breast, 
 
 And there s a sweet sob in it like rain still rain in the 
 
 night. 
 
 Among the leaves of the trumpet-tree, close to his nesl, 
 The pea-dove sings, and each note thrills me with strange 
 
 delight 
 Like the words, wet with music, that well from your 
 
 trembling throat. 
 
 I m afraid of your eyes, they re so bold, 
 Searching me through, reading my thoughts, shining 
 
 like gold. 
 But sometimes they are gentle and soft like the dew on 
 
 the lips of the eucharis 
 Before the sun comes warm with his lover s kiss, 
 
 You are sea-foam, pure with the star s loveliness, 
 Not mortal, a flower, a fairy, too fair for the beauty-shorn 
 
 earth, 
 All wonderful things, all beautiful things, gave of their 
 
 wealth to your birth: 
 O I love you so much, not recking of passion, that I 
 
 feel it is wrong, 
 But men will love you, flower, fairy, non-mortal spirit 
 
 burdened with flesh, 
 Forever, life-long.
