The Barrier tX 
 
 I must not gaze at them although 
 Your eyes are dawning day ; 
 
 I must not watch you as you go 
 Your sun-illumined way; 
 
 I hear but I must never heed 
 
 The fascinating note, 
 Which, fluting like a river reed, 
 
 Comes from your trembling throat; 
 
 I must not see upon your face 
 Love s softly glowing spark; 
 
 For there s the barrier of race, 
 You re fair and I am dark.
