But I would be on the island of the sea, 
 In the heart of the island of the sea, 
 Where the cocks are crowing-, crowing-, crowing-, 
 And the hens are cackling- in the rose-apple tree, 
 Where the old draft-horse is neighing, neighing, neighing 
 
 Out on the brown dew-silvered lawn, 
 And the tethered cow is lowing-, lowing-, lowing, 
 And dear old Ned is braying-, braying-, braying;, 
 And the shag-gy Nannie goat is calling-, calling, calling 
 From her little trampled corner of the long wide lea 
 That stretches to the waters of the hill-stream falling 
 Sheer upon the flat rocks joyously ! 
 There, oh there ! on the island of the sea 
 There I would be at dawn. 
 
 The Choice 
 
 O you would clothe me in silken frocks 
 
 And house me from the cold, 
 And bind with bright bands my glossy locks 
 
 And buy me chains of gold; 
 
 And give me meekly to do my will 
 
 The hapless sons of men: 
 But the wild goat bounding on the barren hill 
 
 Droops in the grassy pen.
