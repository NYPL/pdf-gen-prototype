Sukee River 
 
 Thou sweet-voiced stream that first gavest me drink, 
 
 Watched o er me when I floated on thy breast, J 
 What black-faced boy now gambols on thy brink, 
 
 Or finds beneath thy rocks a place of rest? 
 What naked lad doth linger long by thee, 
 
 And run and tumble in the sun-scorched sand, 
 Or heed the pea-dove in the wild fig tree, 
 
 While I am roaming in an alien land? 
 No wonder that my heart is happy never, 
 I have been faithless to thee, Sukee River. 
 
 When from my early wandering I returned, 
 
 Did I not promise to remain for aye? 
 Yet instantly for other regions yearned 
 
 And wearied of thee in a single day. 
 Thy murmurs sound now in my anguished ears, 
 
 Creating in my heart a world of pain ; 
 I see thee wistful flowing down the years 
 
 And though I pine, afar I must remain : 
 No wonder that my feet are faltering ever, 
 I have been faithless to thee, Sukee River. 
 
 Though other boys may frolic by thy side, 
 
 I know their merry moods thou dost not heed : - 
 
 When I, O mother of my soul and bride, 
 
 Lie on strange breasts and on strange kisses feed. 
 Sometimes, kind fate permitting me, I dream 
 
 I am floating on thy bosom of deep blue, 
 A child again, beloved, unchanging stream ; 
 
 But soon I wake to find it all untrue : 
 I vowed that never, never would we sever, 
 But I ve been faithless to thee, Sukee River.
