Winter in the Country 
 
 Sweet life ! how lovely to be 
 
 And feel the soft sea-laden breeze 
 
 Strike my flushed face, the spruce s fair 
 Free limbs to see, the lesser trees 
 
 Bare hands to touch, the sparrow s cheep 
 To heed, and watch his nimble flight 
 
 Above the short brown grass asleep. 
 Love glorious in his friendly might, 
 
 Music that every heart could bless, 
 And thoughts of life serene, divine, 
 
 Beyond my power to express 
 
 Crowd round this lifted heart of mine I 
 
 But oh ! to leave this paradise 
 
 For-tfae city s dirty basement room, 
 
 Where, beauty hidden from the eyes, 
 A table, bed, bureau and broom 
 
 In corner set, two crippled chairs 
 All covered up with dust and grim 
 
 With hideousness and scars of years, 
 And gaslight burning weird and dim, 
 
 Will welcome me ... And yet, and yet 
 The sea-wind here, the winter birds, 
 
 The glory of the soft sunset, 
 There come to me in words.
