Alfonso, Dressing to Wait at Table, 
 Sings 
 
 Alfonso is a handsome bronze-hued lad 
 Of subtly-changing ancf surprising parts; 
 
 His moods are storms that frighten and make glad, 
 His eyes were made to capture women s hearts. 
 
 Down in the glory-hole Alfonso sings 
 
 An olden song of wine and clinking glasses 
 
 And riotous rakes; magnificently flings 
 Gay kisses to imaginary lasses. 
 
 Alfonso s voice of mellow music thrills 
 
 Our swaying forms and steals our hearts with joy; 
 
 And, when he soars, his fine falsetto trills 
 Are rarest notes of gold without alloy. 
 
 But O! Alfonso, wherefore do you sing 
 
 Dream-songs of carefree men and ancient places? 
 
 Soon shall we be beset by clamouring 
 Of hungry and importunate palefaces.
