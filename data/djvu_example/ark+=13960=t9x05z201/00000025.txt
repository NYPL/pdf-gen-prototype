Love Song 
 
 Heart of the saffron rose, 
 
 Lines of the lily red, 
 Gold of the buttercup, 
 
 Dew of the daisies bed, 
 Flight of the rising bird 
 
 Luring me to the skies, 
 Smile of an evening star 
 
 Playing before mine eyes, 
 
 Rime of the silver morn 
 
 Fair on the green of trees, 
 Scent of the coffee blooms 
 
 Waking the drowsy bees; 
 Charming and beautiful, 
 
 Rare are these sights to see ; 
 But more than all and more 
 
 Is your fond heart to me.
