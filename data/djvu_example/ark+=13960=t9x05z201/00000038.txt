 Harlem Shadows 
 
 I hear the halting footsteps of a lass 
 
 In Negro Harlem when the night lets fall 
 
 Its veil. I see the shapes of girls who pass 
 Eager to heed desire s insistent call : 
 
 Ah, little dark girls, who in slippered feet 
 
 Go prowling throught the night from street to street. 
 
 Through the long night until the silver break 
 
 Of day the little gray feet know no rest, 
 Through the lone night until the last snow-flake 
 
 Has dropped from heaven upon the earth s white breast, 
 The dusky, half-clad girls of tired feet 
 Are trudging, thinly shod, from street to street. 
 
 Ah, stern harsh world, that in the wretched way 
 
 Of poverty, dishonour and disgrace, 
 Has pushed the timid little feet of clay. 
 
 The sacred brown feet of my fallen race ! 
 Ah, heart of me, the weary, weary feet 
 In Harlem wandering from street to street.
