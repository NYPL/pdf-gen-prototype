To Work 
 
 The Dawn ! the Dawn, the crimson-tinted comes 
 
 Out of the low still skies, over the hills, 
 
 New York s fantastic spires and cheerless domes,- 
 
 The Dawn ! my spirit to its spirit thrills. 
 
 Almost the mighty city is asleep, 
 
 No pushing- crowd, no tramping, tramping feet; 
 
 But here and there a few cars, groaning, creep 
 
 Along, above and underneath the street, 
 
 Bearing their strangely-ghostly burdens by, 
 
 The women and the men of garish nights, 
 
 Their eyes wine-weakened and their clothes awry, 
 
 Nodding under the strong electric lights. 
 
 On through the waning shadows of New York, 
 
 Before the Dawn, I wend my way to work.
