I Shall Return 
 
 I shall return again ; I shall return 
 
 To laugh and love and watch with wonder-eyes, 
 
 At golden noon the forest fires burn, 
 
 Wafting their blue-black smoke to sapphire skies. 
 
 I shall return to loiter by the streams 
 
 That bathe the brown blades of the bending grasses, 
 
 And realise once more my thousand dreams 
 
 Of waters rushing down the mountain passes. 
 
 I shall return, to hear the fiddle and fife 
 
 Of village dances, dear delicious tunes 
 
 That stir the hidden depths of native life, 
 
 Stray melodies of dim remembered runes : 
 
 I shall return, I shall return again 
 
 To ease my mind of long, long years of pain.
