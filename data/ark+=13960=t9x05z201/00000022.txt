Morning Joy 
 
 At night the wide and level stretch of wold, 
 
 Which at high noon had basked in quiet gold, 
 
 Far as the eye could see was ghostly white; 
 
 Dark was the night save for the snow s weird light. 
 
 I drew the shades far down, crept into bed; 
 Hearing the cold wind moaning overhead 
 Through the sad pines, my soul, catching its pain, 
 Went sorrowing with it across the plain. 
 
 At dawn behold ! the pall of night was gone 
 Save where a few shrubs melancholy, lone, 
 Detained part of its shadow. Golden-lipped 
 The laughing grasses heaven s sweet wine sipped. 
 
 The sun rose smiling o er the river s breast, 
 And my soul, by his happy spirit blest, 
 Soared like a bird to greet him in the sky 
 And drew out of his heart Eternity.
