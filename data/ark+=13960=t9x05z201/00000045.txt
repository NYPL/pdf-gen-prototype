 Exhortation 
 
 Through the pregnant universe rumbles life s terrific 
 
 thunder 
 And Earth s bowels quake with terror; strange and 
 
 terrible storms break, 
 Lightning-torches flame the heavens, kindling souls of 
 
 men thereunder: 
 Africa! long ages sleeping, Oh my motherland, awake! 
 
 In the East the clouds glow crimson with the new dawn 
 
 that is breaking, 
 
 And its golden glory fills the western skies: 
 Oh my brothers and my sisters, wake! arise! 
 For the new birth rends the old earth and the very dead 
 
 are waking, 
 Ghosts are turned flesh, throwing off the grave s dis 
 
 guise, 
 
 And the foolish, even children, are made wise; 
 For the big earth groans in travail for the strong, new 
 
 world in making 
 
 Oh my brothers, dreaming for dim centuries, 
 Wake from sleeping; to the East turn, turn you eyes! 
 
 Oh the night is sweet for sleeping, but the shining day s 
 
 for working; 
 Sons of the seductive night, for your children s child 
 
 ren s sake, 
 From the deep primeval forests where the crouching 
 
 leopard s lurking, 
 Lift your heavy-lidded eyes, Ethiopia! awake!
