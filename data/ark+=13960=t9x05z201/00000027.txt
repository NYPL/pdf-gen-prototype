Rest in Peace 
 
 No more for you the city s thorny ways, 
 The ugly corners of the Negro belt; 
 
 The miseries and pains of these harsh days 
 By you will never, never again be felt. 
 
 No more, if still you wander, will you meet 
 
 With nights of unabating bitterness, 
 They cannot reach you in your safe retreat, 
 
 The city s hate, the city s prejudice ! 
 
 Twas sudden but your menial task is done, 
 The dawn now breaks on you, the dark is over, 
 
 The sea is crossed, the longed-for port is won, 
 Farewell, oh fare you well ! fond friend and lover.
