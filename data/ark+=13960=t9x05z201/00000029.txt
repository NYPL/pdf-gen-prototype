To Winter 
 
 Stay, season of calm love and soulful snows I 
 
 There is a subtle sweetness in the sun, 
 
 The ripples on the stream s breast gaily run, 
 
 The wind more boisterously by me blows, 
 
 And each succeeding- day now longer grows. 
 
 The birds a gladder music have begun, 
 
 The squirrel, full of mischief and of fun, 
 
 From maples topmost branch small brown twigs 
 
 throws. 
 
 I read these pregnant signs, know what they mean : 
 I know that thou art making ready to go. 
 Oh stay ! . . . I fled a land where fields are green 
 Always, and palms wave gently to and fro, 
 And winds are balmy, blue brooks ever sheen, 
 To ease my heart of its impassioned woe.
