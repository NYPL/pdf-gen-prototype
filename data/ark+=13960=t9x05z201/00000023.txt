Reminiscences 
 
 When the day is at its dimmest 
 
 And the air is wild with snow, 
 And the city s at its grimmest 
 
 In mine eyes there is a glow. . . . 
 When the day is at its brightest 
 
 And the city is a dream, 
 And my heart is at its lightest, 
 
 In mine eyes there is a gleam ; 
 For I m thinking, O I m thinking, 
 
 Of an old worn sugar-mill 
 Where the southern sun is sinking 
 
 Gold and crimson o er the hill; 
 And I hear the toilers talking 
 
 As they shoulder pick and hoe, 
 And I watch their steady walking 
 
 To the quiet plain below. 
 O ! I see the white stream dashing 
 
 Gay and reckless through the brake, 
 O er the root-entwined rocks washing 
 
 Swiftly, madly to the lake; 
 O ! I hear the waters falling, 
 
 Flowing, falling, flowing free, 
 And the sound of voices calling 
 
 O er the billows of the sea.
