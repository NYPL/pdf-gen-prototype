The Spanish Needle 
 
 Lovely dainty Spanish needle 
 
 With your yellow flower and white, 
 
 Dew bedecked and softly sleeping, 
 Do you think of me to-night? 
 
 Shadowed by the spreading mango, 
 Nodding o er the rippling stream, 
 
 Tell me, dear plant of my childhood, 
 Do you of the exile dream? 
 
 Do you see me by the brook s side 
 Catching crayfish neath the stone, 
 
 As you did the day you whispered: 
 Leave the harmless dears alone? 
 
 Do you see me in the meadow 
 Coming from the woodland spring 
 
 With a bamboo on my shoulder 
 And a pail slung from a string? 
 
 Do you see me all expectant 
 
 Lying in an orange grove, 
 While the swee-swees sing above me, 
 
 Waiting for my elf-eyed love? 
 
 Lovely dainty Spanish needle, 
 Source to me of sweet delight, 
 
 In your far-off sunny southland 
 Do you dream of me to-night?
