Flowers of Passion 
 
 The dancers have departed, dear, 
 And the last song has been sung- ; 
 
 The red-stained glasses mock my gaze 
 And the fiddle lies unstrung. 
 
 And I m alone, alone once more, 
 Save for your sweet brown face 
 
 That comes reproachfully to me 
 In this unholy place. 
 
 I ve kissed a thousand flowers, my own, 
 Gone drunk with their perfume ; 
 
 But found out, when the madness passed, 
 You were the one pure bloom. 
 
 I ve come to realise at last 
 
 How awful it may be 
 To cut adrift from sacred ties 
 
 And be completely free. 
 
 But life grows many flowers, my love, 
 
 Within its garden wall, 
 And passion s are the strangest 
 
 And the deadliest of all.
