North and South 
 
 O sweet are tropic lands for waking dreams ! 
 
 There time and life move lazily along-; 
 There by the banks of blue-and-silver streams 
 
 Grass-sheltered crickets chirp incessant song, 
 Gay-coloured lizards loll all through the day, 
 
 Their tongues outstretched for careless little flies, 
 And swarthy children in the fields at play 
 
 Look upward laughing at the smiling skies. 
 A breath of idleness is in the air 
 
 That casts a subtle spell upon all things, 
 And love and mating-time are everywhere 
 
 And wonder to life s commonplaces clings. 
 The fluttering humming-bird darts through the trees 
 
 And dips his long beak in the big bell-flowers, 
 The leisured buzzard floats upon the breeze 
 
 Riding a crescent cloud for endless hours; 
 The sea beats softly on the emerald strands, 
 O sweet for dainty dreams are tropic lands !
